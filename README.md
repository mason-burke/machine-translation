# machine-translation

## overview
Using Transformer/RNN sequence-to-sequence models, we can translate French sentences into English. A fair portion of the time spent on this project was getting a solid understanding of how transformers work.

## disclaimers
This project was originally an assignment for my Deep Learning course, taken in Fall 2021. Some of the files were filled out already as part of a template. I included them in order to allow everything to function properly if downloaded. I wrote the entirety of assignment.py, rnn_model.py, transformer_model.py, and some of preprocess.py.

## how to use

To run this project, navigate to the root directory, download the data and create a virtual environment using the scripts provided. Then, navigate to project/code, and run assignment.py.
