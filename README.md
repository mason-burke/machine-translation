# machine-translation

Using Transformer/RNN sequence-to-sequence models, we can translate French sentences into English. A fair portion of the time spent on this project was getting a solid understanding of how transformers work.

This project was originally an assignment for my Deep Learning course, taken in Fall 2021. Some of the files were filled out already as part of a template. I included them in order to allow everything to function properly if downloaded. I wrote the entirety of assignment.py, rnn_model.py, transformer_model.py, and some of preprocess.py.
